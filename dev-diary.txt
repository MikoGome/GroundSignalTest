    I just received the code test from Ground Signal, it seems like I'll have to code out a map navigation type application. 
I never made an application like this before but it seems like it'll be fun. The email says that I should incorporate React, Redux, Tailwind, and Leaflet. 
This doesn't seem too bad as I already have plenty of experience with React and Redux. Tailwind is something that I never used before but always had an interest in learning
so this seems like a good opportunity to finally learn it. I never heard of Leaflet before but looking at the docs it seems pretty easy to pick up.
For now, I'll just clone the repository and just disable google's default UI elements by adding a "disableDefaultUI" property with the value of True to the map object in main.js.

    Today, I'll try to get the functionality working. For now, I'll set up the React environment and incorporate a Redux store. 
I am running into a problem when migrating my <div class="map"></div> into a React Component,the map isn't showing up. 
After messing around and reading Leaflet docs, it turns out that it was having a height of 0px so a quick css adjustment was able to fix that.
To incorporate leaflet, I think that I have to get rid of the google maps api. Right now, I'm using the URL "https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" provided
by leaflet docs but I'll have to change the tile later to make it look more like the picture. For now I'll work on the search feature.
