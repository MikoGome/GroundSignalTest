    I just received the code test from Ground Signal, it seems like I'll have to code out a map navigation type application. 
I never made an application like this before but it seems like it'll be fun. The email says that I should incorporate React, Redux, Tailwind, and Leaflet. 
This doesn't seem too bad as I already have plenty of experience with React and Redux. Tailwind is something that I never used before but always had an interest in learning
so this seems like a good opportunity to finally learn it. I never heard of Leaflet before but looking at the docs it seems pretty easy to pick up.
For now, I'll just clone the repository and just disable google's default UI elements by adding a "disableDefaultUI" property with the value of True to the map object in main.js.

    Today, I'll try to get the functionality of the serach bar and modal working. First, I'll set up the React environment and incorporate a Redux store. 
I am running into a problem when migrating my <div class="map"></div> into a React Component, the map isn't showing up. 
After messing around, it turns out that it was having a height of 0px so a quick css adjustment was able to fix that.
To incorporate leaflet, I think that I have to get rid of the google map api code that was provided but right now, I'll just use the "https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" provided
by leaflet docs but I'll change this to the google tile later to make it look more like the picture.
    Thinking about how I think the app will work, there should be at least 2 reducers. One to handle the state of the search functionality and one to handle the state of modal
functionality. There might be one for the markers functionality but I'll see when I get to it.
    After finishing up the modal and search bar functionality and components, I tried reading up on the google api docs to try to link Leaflet with the google map tiles.
However, I found out that the API key that was given to me for this assessment wasn't going to work. Luckily I was able to find another API that will give me the desired
tiles without an API key.
